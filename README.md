# My Journy into React
## research notes
- index.js file needed to render App.js component
- App.js file is used to act as a hub for all components
- Why is it necessary to separate components into different files?
    - only because it gets unruly when you have too many components
    - technically possible to keep all of the components on one file  
    - if you have a big site, you can start separating components into files
- React is a lot like PHP
