# My Journy into React
## research notes
- index.js file needed to render App.js component
    - not intirely true, index just combines all of the components and renders them all like a hub.
- App.js file is used to act as a hub for all components
    - I originaly thought the App.js was the hub that renders all components but that's really been separated out to be handled by index.js
    - App.js is just another component
- Why is it necessary to separate components into different files?
    - only because it gets unruly when you have too many components
    - technically possible to keep all of the components on one file  
    - if you have a big site, you can start separating components into files
- React is a lot like PHP
- return can only render the first component
# Props
- props are basically attributes
